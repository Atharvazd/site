On December 21, 2016, the Hearing Vietnam club visited Hy Vong 1 school to donate and teach the students about bone conduction. This event was a success and was an eye-opening experience for the hearing impaired students who were listening to audiobooks/music for the first time in their life. In the future, Hearing Vietnam hopes to continue transforming education for the hearing impaired students in Vietnam by providing bone conduction technology to their school. For queries/donations, please email nrajpal18@ssis.edu.vn.
