In the many technological advancements that has been occurring recently, more devices to enhance the living of those with disabilities are being invented. The bone conduction headphones are an excellent example of an innovative device made to improve the life of the hearing impaired. Commercially, bone conduction headphones are used for athletes, however, Hearing Vietnam is using this technology for the first time to help the hearing impaired students in Vietnam. 

The bone conduction headphones is a device that bypasses hearing through the eardrum, and passes the vibrations through the bones (skull) or the skin. This allows for those with hearing disabilities to be able to hear music and audiobooks. Bone conduction  headphones opens up amazing opportunities in education for those who are using it. On December 21, 2016, the Hearing Vietnam group visited a school for the hearing impaired, Hy Vong 1 school for Auditory Handicapped Children District 1, HCMC. Hearing Vietnam sourced the bone conduction headphones through crowdfunding (via Stellup: https://stellup.com/club/303) and fundraisers held in Saigon South International School. During this special event, the bone conduction headphones were presented to a group of students. A bag included an mp4 player and a bone conduction headphone. Each student had the chance to try on the headphones and listen to a variety of music genres and audiobooks. This was an eye-opening experience for the deaf students as some haven’t been able to use headphones and listen to music. The bone conduction headphones can also significantly aid in their learning.  Audiobooks prepared by the Hearing Vietnam group include basics of learning english. Informative audiobooks include the english alphabet and numbers. A few contributors attended this event realizing the amazing things that their donations are going to. The headphones and mp4 players are to be put in the school’s computer lab for all the students of different ages and levels may use the headphones. The donation was well appreciated by the head of school, Ms. Tran Thi Ngoi who personally thanked the founder of the organization, Nirat Singh Rajpal. Moving forward, Hearing Vietnam looks to transform education for the hearing impaired students in Vietnam by providing bone conduction headphones to multiple hearing impaired school.
